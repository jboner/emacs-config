Note: there still a number of bugs in this VDBTest.py, but it's usable if
you're careful of one thing, and its the best demo I have for the new stuff
I've added to text buffer:

The biggest bug is actually not in VDBTest.py but in natlink, apparently, as
it is reproducible in Joel's windict.py as well.  When bringing up the
correction dialog box with "Correct That" or correct xyz, be careful not to
start another utterance before or even slightly after the correction box
appears.  Otherwise, the python application may hang.  Eventually, you may get
the Server Busy dialog box telling you to click on the taskbar icon for
python, but that doesn't seem to help, so you might as well kill the
application by killing the DOS box from which you launched it, or with
Ctrl-Alt-Del and End Task.  Fortunately, you should be able to turn off the
NaturallySpeaking microphone, and NaturallySpeaking itself shouldn't crash.
I've been emailing Joel about this, and he's sent me one (unfortunately
unsucessful) attempt at a fix, so hopefully this will be taken care of.

A second bug also affects NaturallySpeaking.  Occasionally, if VDBTest is
closed improperly, natlink.DictObj will still have an active begin or change
callback pointing to nowhere.  Then, whenever you start an utterance, you get
a couple of Dragon COM error message boxes popping up.  In this case, you will
have to shut down NaturallySpeaking, and then use Ctrl-Alt-Del + end task to
kill the residual Natspeak task which won't close because natlink thinks that
it is still connected to an application, and then restart NaturallySpeaking.
Fortunately, I've added some things to VDBTest so that it usually cleans up
after itself, so this problem is pretty rare now.  The one thing they used to
cause it consistently was exiting VDBTest by voice with "Click File", "exit".
Even that seems to work fine now.

Then, there are a number of other small bugs and inconveniences.  The log
window seems to be limited to about 55K, so if you dictate for a while, it
will stop recording output.  You can close the program and start it again, or
type

the_pane.log.Clear()

at the command line to clear the window.  I've tried to cut down on the
nonessential diagnostic message is going to the log window, so this should be
less frequent.  I've e-mailed the wxPython people and it sounds like this is
fixable, but I don't have the details yet.

Finally, there is a lot of translation between buffers which use \r\n for new
lines and ones which use \n.  wxTextCtrl uses a RichEdit control internally,
which uses \r\n.  wxTextCtrl automatically translates when you get or set
text, but doesn't take this into account in functions specifying character
ranges.  NaturallySpeaking also uses \r\n internally.  The TextBufferWX and
VoiceDictBuffer wrappers are supposed to translate so that VoiceCode can use
\n exclusively.  However, there still at least one bug in one of the two
wrappers, so you may on rare occasions get messages about discrepancies
between two buffers, or may see some odd things.  The most common symptom is
that one or more small black rectangles will appear at the end of the line.
These represent nonprinting characters, usually a \r (= octal 15) which has
gotten separated from its \n.  In more extreme cases, select-and-say may
select the wrong character ranges because the voice buffer and screen buffer
have gotten out of synch.  If you encounter either of these symptoms, make a
note of what you were doing, a copy of the last screen or two of the log
window and the last dozen or so lines printed in the MS-DOS box, and send them
to me.

Incidentally, when using select and say, you will occasionally get messages in
the log window warning you about a "selection mismatch".  Unlike the other
"discrepancy" messages, these are normal and the mismatch should be temporary
(you won't continue to see messages about selection mismatches).  There was a
bug which caused serious selection mismatches, but I've fixed it.
