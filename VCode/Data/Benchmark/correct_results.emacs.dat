Exporting abbreviations from an empty SymDict, so

no differences found

version number unchanged

comparing symdict.dict created from scratch with
the reference dictionary current_symdict.dict
ERROR: contents of persistent SymDict dictionary appears
to have changed, without a change in the version number.
Both current_symdict.dict and symdict.dict
(the latter created from scratch) have version 5
but the following differences were found:

element 1 of attribute 'spoken_forms' of item 'F_FRSIZE' of item 'symbol_info'
missing from first argument

element 1 of attribute 'spoken_forms' of item 'O_APPEND' of item 'symbol_info'
missing from first argument

element 1 of attribute 'spoken_forms' of item 'O_RSYNC' of item 'symbol_info'
missing from first argument

element 1 of attribute 'spoken_forms' of item 'f_lineno' of item 'symbol_info'
missing from first argument

element 1 of attribute 'spoken_forms' of item 'o_sample_rate' of item 'symbol_info'
missing from first argument


These differences could be due to a change to
the persistent SymDict format without a corresponding
increment in current_version in SymDict.py.  They could
also be due to changes to the algorithm for generating
spoken forms for known symbols, or to the input files
py_abbrevs.py and selected_py_sym.py in
%VCODE_HOME%\Data\TestData

If these differences do reflect changes made to
the persistent SymDict format, you must:
  1. increment current_version in SymDict.py
  2. create a new SingleVersionDictConverter to
     convert from the old version
  3. prepend this converter to the global symdict_cvtr
     in SymDict.py
  4. re-run this test to verify that the old version
     can be properly converted


If these differences are simply due to changes
in the input files or the algorithms, then you must
verify the new stored symdict.dict in 
%VCODE_HOME%\Data\TestData
manually, and then copy it to current_symdict.dict
in the same directory.
