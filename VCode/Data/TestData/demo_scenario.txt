    Scenario for a demo of VoiceCode
    ================================

Last modified: 2004-10-14


Before the demo
---------------

- DISABLE ERGOSENTERY (for Alain Desilets)

- IF USING A LAPTOP AND IT IS CONNECTED THROUGH WIRELESS CONNECTION,
  MAKE SURE THAT THE LAPTOP POWER MANAGEMENT ARE SET SO THAT IT NEVER
  GOES TO SLEEP. IF IT GOES TO SLEEP, MEDIATOR WILL LOSE SOCKET CONNECTION
  WITH EMACS WHEN SYSTEM GOES TO SLEEP!!!

  On Alain's laptop, it is sufficient to make sure that the laptop is
  plugged into the power outlet (it doesn't go to sleep when 
  plugged into the outlet).
  
- Open file Data/TestData/large_buff.py

- Compile the symbols
    
- Open new file demo.py  


Start demo by writing a bubble sorting class in demo.py
-------------------------------------------------------
   
- Dictate it in one go without stopping to explain what is going on.

- Afterwards, redictate it, stopping each step of the way to 
  point out interesting things.
  
- If you need to talk about things that didn't show up during the 
  dictation of buble sort, just dictate it on the side.

- Code for the bubble sort could look something like this:

class SortingStrategy:
   def sort(self, list):
      pass

class BubbleSorter(SortingStrategy):
   def sort(self, list):
      if len(list) == 0:
         return list
      for index1 in range(len(list) - 1):
         for index2 in range(index1 + 1, len(list)):
            if list[index1] < list[index2]:
               self.swap_elements(index1, index2, list)

   def swap_elements(self, index1, index2, list):
      temporary = list[index1]
      list[index1] = list[index2]
      list[index2] = temporary

some_list = [1,  - 5, 2, 3, 1]
print BubbleSorter().sort(some_list)
        
- Some interesting points to highlight during dissection afterwards
  discussed below.
      

Natural pausing
---------------

    - Never HAVE TO pause anywhere
    
    - But CAN pause anywhere between commands or pseudo-symbols
      (but CANNOT pause in the middle of a command or pseudo-symbol)


Correction     
----------

    - uses smart undo-redo

    - automatically adapts so that it won't make the same mistake again (hopefully)


Code templates
--------------

    - When you said "define method", some stuff got typed automatically 
      (eg: self and list of arguments of method)

    - Simple navigation through template with "add argument", 
      "do the following", etc...

    - Show context sensitivity of template by saying "if check if okay then do".
      The first if gets interpreted as an if statement because it's at the 
      beginning of a line, but the second if is interpreted as being part of
      a new symbol.
    
          
Automatic indentation and de-indentation
----------------------------------------

    - "new statement" automatically indents to the right level
    
    - Back indent automatically deindents to right level
    
    
New symbol dictation
--------------------

   - Everytime you say something that is not a command, system 
     formatted it as a NEW symbol (at least in the bubble sort
     example).
     
   - Show how formattting of new symbols is context sensitive.
     Dictate a new class name within a "define method" utterance, and show that
     the class was automatically formatted using CapitalHungarian formatting. 
     Show that another new symbol dictated outside of the class name context
     formats it in lowercase with underscore.
   
Existing symbol dictation
-------------------------

   - Display demo.py and large_buff.py one above the other and compile
     symbols from large_buff.py.

   - In demo.py, dictate some existing symbols from large_buff.py.
     Some good ones are:
     * prof_test ("profile test")
     * init_attrs ("init attributes" or "init attributes")
     * profConstrSmallObj ("profile constructor small object", "prof constructor small obj")

   - Show how the same existing symbol can be dictated in different ways:
       num_times = "num times" or "number times"


Symbol reformatting
-------------------

    - When we have a symbol correction dialog working, show how that's done.
    
    - Do it for both new and existing symbols.


Local navigation by punctuation
-------------------------------

    - Navigate by different punctuation marks

    - Show how you can qualify the search with 
      * "previous one"
      * "next one"

    - Show how you can repeat the commands
      * "again"
      * "again 2 times"

   - Point out that there are other repeatable commands


Local navigation by PseudoCode
------------------------------

-  move to a line by selecting parts of it

- then insert a new statement above it


Global navigation by switch buffer
----------------------------------

- Make sure at least two buffers opened

- "Emacs switch buffer", "select buffer name", "newline"


Multiple ways of saying the same thing
--------------------------------------

- "class some class"
- "define class some class"
- "class definition some class"


Language sensitivity
--------------------

Dictate same class definition in C and Python files and show the difference.
